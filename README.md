# Battleship_Game
Simple Battleship game in python

To play game you need Beta.py, Tlo1.jpg, Tlogra.jpg and pirat.mp3 in one directory. Then write in console 'python3 Beta.py'
pyg.exe, start.bat are experiments with launching it on Windows, they won't work propably :D.

This is my first bigger code that I written, and I know +-1200 lines are totally not within clean code rules :)
Just forget it and have fun.
